You can find what is it
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform)

Basically it's an algorithm used to detect and describe local features in
digital images. It locates certain _key points_ and then furnishes them with
quantitative information (so-called _descriptors_) which can for example be used
for object recognition. The descriptors are supposed to be invariant against
various transformations which might make images look different although they
represent the same object(s).

It is used to detect similar points in image with affine transformations
(scale, rotation ..)
